# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I really find this content interesting and believe it to be a very good paper for my future.
- I am interested in learning about Computer Graphics and ddata processing.
